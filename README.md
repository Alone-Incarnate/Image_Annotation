Object Detection and Annotation with YOLOv8
This project demonstrates how to use the Ultralytics YOLOv8 model for object detection in images. The script loads an image, performs object detection, and annotates the detected objects by drawing bounding boxes and labels on the image.

ðŸš€ Features
Object detection using the powerful YOLOv8 model.
Visualize detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.
Simple, clear code with annotations displayed using OpenCV.
ðŸ›  Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed before running the script:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Ultralytics (pip install ultralytics)
ðŸ“‚ Model and Image Setup
Download the YOLOv8 model: Ensure you have the yolov8n.pt model file available in your working directory. This is the model that performs object detection.

Input Image: Replace "Your_image_path.jpg" with the path to the image you want to process.

ðŸ’¡ Understanding the Script
1. Loading the YOLOv8 Model
The YOLOv8 model is loaded to facilitate object detection on images.

2. Annotate Image
A function annotate_image is defined to draw bounding boxes and labels on detected objects within the image.

3. Display Results
The image is displayed with annotations using OpenCV's GUI functions.

ðŸ“œ Code Explanation
1. Loading the Model:
The YOLOv8 model is loaded using the Ultralytics library:

python
Copy code
model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')  # Load YOLOv8 model
2. Object Detection:
The model performs detection on the input image:

python
Copy code
results = model(image)
3. Image Annotation:
The annotate_image function creates a copy of the input image and draws bounding boxes and labels for each detected object:

python
Copy code
def annotate_image(image, results):
    # Annotating the image
    ...
4. Displaying the Image:
Use OpenCV to display the annotated image in a window:

python
Copy code
cv2.imshow('Annotated Image', annotated_image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
ðŸ“· Example Output

By following these instructions, you will be able to load an image, perform object detection, and visualize the results with annotations.
