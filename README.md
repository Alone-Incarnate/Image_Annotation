**Object Detection and Annotation with YOLOv8**
This project demonstrates how to use the Ultralytics YOLOv8 model for object detection in images. The script loads an image, performs object detection, and annotates the detected objects by drawing bounding boxes and labels on the image.

**Requirements**
Ensure you have the following installed before running the script:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Ultralytics



**Model and Image Setup:**

Ensure you have the yolov8n.pt model file available in your working directory. This is the YOLOv8 model that performs object detection.
Replace "Your_image_path.jpg" with the path to the image you want to process.

**Understanding the Script:**

**Load the YOLOv8 Model:** The YOLOv8 model is loaded to facilitate object detection on images.
**Annotate Image:** A function annotate_image is defined to draw bounding boxes and labels on detected objects within the image.
**Display Results:** The image is displayed with annotations using OpenCV's GUI functions.
**Code Explanation**
**Loading the Model:** The YOLO model is loaded using the Ultralytics library.
**Image Annotation:** The annotate_image function creates a copy of the input image and draws bounding boxes and labels for each detected object.
**Object Detection:** The model performs detection on the input image, and the results are used to annotate the image.
**Displaying the Image:** OpenCV is used to display the annotated image in a window.
By following these instructions, you will be able to load an image, perform object detection, and visualize the results with annotations.
